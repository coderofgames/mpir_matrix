    MPIR matrix test
========================================================================
This example is a test component for the matrix project
for use of libraries with abitrary precision floating point
numbers. Based on an MPIR test named cxx.ops. If the MPIR test
works, this should work.

The components of the MPIR C and C++ library are under LGPL or
whatever they but the implementation of the matrix in the sample 
is equivalent to the MIT license. 

The example contains binaries, if you can't deal with binaries
then compile them yourself with the instructions from the
MPIR website.
